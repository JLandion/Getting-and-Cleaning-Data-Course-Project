# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This repository contains the necessary archives for to complete successfully the course project

* In the code book we can find information about the variables obtained and how we have onbtained de tidy data briefly explained

* Th script run_analysis.R contains the code that we have created for to obtain the tidy data

* The data.tidy contains the tidy data that we have created

The tidy data was created acording to the Course project step by step: 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
